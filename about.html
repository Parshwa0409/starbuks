                        <p>
                            Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone
                            streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It
                            was here where Starbucks opened its first store,
                            offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices
                            from around the world for our customers to take
                            home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale,
                            “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the
                            early coffee traders.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard
                            Schultz would walk through these doors and become
                            captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip.
                            After joining the company in 1982, a different
                            cobblestone road would lead him to another
                            discovery. It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that
                            Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and
                            he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth
                            and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks. By
                            1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and
                            embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and
                            Vancouver, Canada and then on to California,
                            Washington, D.C. and New York. By 1996, we would
                            cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan,
                            followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over
                            the next two decades, we would grow to welcome
                            millions of customers each week and become a part of
                            the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all
                            around the world. In everything we do, we are always
                            dedicated to Our Mission: With every cup, with every
                            conversation, with every community - we nurture the
                            limitless possibilities of human connection.

                            – are at the heart of the Starbucks experience. We
